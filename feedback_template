Thank you for submitting your report. It is very well done.
An interesting point to note is that the missing values are not distributed uniformly over the columns. 93 columns have no missing values at all. On the other hand, 67 columns have close to 100% of missing values. I suppose that this peculiarity of the dataset is because the missing values intentionally introduced. Wouldn't expect this in a real data set.
I really like the figures in your report. It was interesting to see the kind of visualizations you can produce for an ML model. Thanks!
